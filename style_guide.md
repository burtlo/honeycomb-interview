presented in this repository. These guideliens are in addition to the existing
company's writing style guide.

### Use present tense to describe output

Avoid future tense or conditional language when talking about the results of an
operation. The results of an operation should be presented as though it has
happened or is guaranteed to happen.

### Give specific instructions when asking practitioners to take action

Avoid instruction that tells the new practitioner to pick any or to make a selection of their choice. Keep the instructions specific.

### Represent user interface terms in bold.

| Good | Bad |
| ---- | --- |
| multiple **Visualize** clauses will result in multiple graphs, one for each calculation | multiple Visualize clauses will result in multiple graphs, one for each calculation |

### Present examples after core information with different presentation

When the core information is finished and example is displayed. I propose that it be represented with different formatting to assist the practitioners to move quickly through the core information and the examples.


### Use consistent language for Events

Is that fields or attributes?

### Use consistent language for Query Builder components

Is it clauses or operations?
